# Unity Junior Programmer Pathway Unit 4 - Gameplay Mechanics

### Summary
In this Unit, you will program an arcade-style Sumo battle with the objective of knocking increasingly difficult waves of enemies off of a floating island, using power ups to help defeat them. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement new gameplay mechanics into your projects, which are new rules or systems that make the game more interesting to play. On one hand, you will learn to program a powerup, which give the player a temporary advantage. On the other hand, you will learn to program increasingly difficult enemy waves, which make survival more challenging for the player. A good balance of powerups and increasing difficulty make for a much more interesting gameplay experience.

### Optional Bonus Features
- [x] **Easy:** Harder enemy
    - Add a new more difficult type of enemy and randomly select which is spawned.
- [x] **Medium:** Homing rockets
    - Create a new powerup that gives the player the ability to launch projectiles at enemies to knock them off (or something that automatically fires projectiles in all directions when the powerup is enabled).
- [x] **Hard:** Smash attack
    - Create a new powerup that allows the player to hop up into the air and smash down onto the ground, sending any enemies nearby flying away from the player. Ideally, the closer an enemy is, the more it should be impacted by the smash.
- [x] **Expert:** Boss battle
    - After a certain number of waves, program a mini “boss battle,” where the boss has some completely new abilities. For example, maybe the boss can fire projectiles at you, maybe it is extremely agile, or maybe it occasionally generates little minions that come after you.
